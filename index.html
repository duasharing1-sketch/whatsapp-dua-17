This heartfelt dua asks Allah ﷻ — by His Names Ar-Rahmān (The Most Merciful) and Ar-Raheem (The Most Compassionate) — to bless us with a good ending after a life lived in His pleasure and obedience.

It is not death we fear — but dying without His love and mercy, without peace, without being ready to meet Him. This is a dua for a soul that returns to Allah honored, tranquil, and beloved.

Allah ﷻ says in the Qur’an:

 "O tranquil soul! Return to your Lord, well pleased with Him and well pleasing ˹to Him˺. So join My servants, and enter My Paradise."(Surah Al-Fajr 89:27–30)

*Ya Allah (O Allah), Ya Rahman (O Most Merciful), Ya Raheem (O Most Compassionate), after a long, prosperous, and fulfilling life in Your pleasure, grant us a good and righteous ending, free from difficulty, suffering, or pain. Let the time leading up to it, and our final moments be blessed, where we are greeted by the angels of mercy and it is recited to us:*

*O tranquil soul! Return to your Lord, well pleased with Him and well pleasing ˹to Him˺. So join My servants, and enter My Paradise.*
